// ngOnInit method will be executed by Angular
// whenever Angular has initialized this component's inputs.
// // there is this question like what is the difference between ngOnInit and constructor
// so ngOnInit is a life cycle hook that is called after Angular has initialized all data-bound properties of a directive.
// constructor is a default method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated and ensures proper 
// initialization of fields in the class and its subclasses.
// ngOnInit is specifically for initialization work.
// constructor is for dependency injection.

implementing lifecycle interfaces

here i learned about the interface,means in our case though i wrote ngonInit method and implement the interface still
it shows error,so to resolve the error we need to import the interface from the angular/core library.
so it will let us know the error and we can resolve it.
